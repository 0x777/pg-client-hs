These are just so we don't get errors when we include <internal/libpq-int.h>.
It seems like that file isn't structured properly, in any case these missing
header files are from the server dev headers (on debian
'postgresql-server-dev-*') and we could depend on that package and pass to gcc:

     -I$(pg_config --includedir-server)  ...

But using these fake header files seems actually safer since we know their
internals don't matter.
